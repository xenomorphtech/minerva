# add context switch traps on every loop

# hotload

# typed

# no C interop, no C deps

# self hosted

# fuck files
a beam like environment, where previous computations can be piped to new stuff preserving their types(not a stream of text/bytes, but the next step on unix philosophy)

# versioned modules

# functions

# what are packages? coherent collections of modules
